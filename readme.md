1. The recommended way to use this, is via cloning the git repository from: https://github.com/illale/DeepLearning9.git
2. requirements.txt should have most pip packages needed
3. the DeepDRiD directory needs to present in the same dir with jupyter notebooks
3. the large .pth files are not included and can be obtained via Git LFS.
4. just execute the jupyter notebooks as normal
